# Homelab Infrastructure

This repo contains all of the configuration and documentation of my homelab.


The purpose of my homelab is to learn and to have fun. Being a DevOps Engineer by day, I work with Kubernetes every day, and my homelab is the place where I can try out and learn new things. On the other hand, by self-hosting some applications, it makes me feel responsible for the entire process of deploying and maintaining an application from A to Z. It forces me to think about backup strategies, security, scalability and the ease of deployment and maintenance.

## Cluster Provisioning

I use [Talos Linux](https://www.talos.dev/) for Kubernetes, because it's secure, immutable, and minimal.
